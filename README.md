# Kaggle Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects based on Kaggle datasets, implemented in different programming languages and frameworks. The first two are projects that I was originally going to use for my university module but were abandoned at the time due to their large scope.

- Communication factors (SMS reminders)

### Implementation Details
The analysis follows a comprehensive machine learning workflow:

**Data Cleansing**
- Treatment of missing values
- Date and time format standardisation

- Time-of-day appointment categories
- NHS age group classification
- Neighbourhood risk categorisation based on historical no-show rates
- Health condition combinations and interactions
- Seasonal and day-of-week patterns

**Advanced Class Balancing**
- Random upsampling of minority class (no-shows)
- Equal representation of show/no-show appointments in training data
- Preservation of original distribution in testing data

**Machine Learning Models**
- XGBoost implementation
- Random Forest classification
- Logistic Regression
- Ensemble model combining all three approaches
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

**Threshold Optimisation**
- F1-score based threshold determination
- Adjustment for class imbalance in predictions
- Precision-recall trade-off analysis

**Model Evaluation**
- ROC curve analysis with AUC metrics
- Confusion matrix assessment
- Feature importance ranking
- Classification performance across patient demographics

### Key Findings
- Waiting time is the strongest predictor of appointment no-shows
- SMS reminders significantly reduce no-show probability
- Young patients with long waiting times have higher no-show rates
- Neighbourhood characteristics influence attendance patterns
- Health conditions impact attendance in complex ways
- The ensemble model achieves superior performance compared to individual models

### Tools and Libraries
- **R Language**: Primary implementation
- **Data Manipulation**: dplyr, tidyr, lubridate
- **Machine Learning**: caret, xgboost, randomForest
- **Model Evaluation**: pROC, confusionMatrix
- **Visualisation**: ggplot2

### Future Work
- Integration of distance/travel time to medical facility
- Inclusion of weather data on appointment days
- Text message content analysis for effectiveness
- Development of an early warning system for high-risk no-shows
- Cost-benefit analysis of intervention strategies

### Usage
The project is implemented in R script format. To run the analysis:
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure R and required packages are installed
3. Run the improved_medical_noshow_prediction.R script
4. Model outputs will be saved in the project directory
