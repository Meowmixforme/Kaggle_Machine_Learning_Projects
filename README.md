## Project 12: # Credit Card Default Prediction with SMOTE

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to predict credit card defaults using supervised machine learning. The workflow handles class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model comparison across several algorithms.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Credit Card Default Dataset
- **Features:**
  - Demographic information (SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE, AGE)
  - Credit history (LIMIT_BAL)
  - Payment history (PAY_0 to PAY_6)
  - Bill statements (BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6) 
  - Previous payments (PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6)
  - DEFAULT: Target variable (1 = default, 0 = no default)
- **Size:** 30,000 clients

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and visualisation of features
- Handling of categorical variables through one-hot encoding
- Replacement of special values in EDUCATION and MARRIAGE columns
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler

### Feature Engineering
- Utilisation ratio (bill amount to credit limit)
- Payment to bill ratio
- Delay history (count of months with payment delays)
- Maximum delay indicator
- Average bill and payment amounts
- Bill trend analysis
- Payment consistency metrics

### Class Imbalance Handling
- The positive class (default) represents only 22.12% of the data
- SMOTE applied to balance the training data
- Test data kept in original distribution to maintain realistic evaluation

### Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Linear SVM**
- **CatBoost**

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- ROC curves and AUC scores
- Cross-validation results for model stability
- Threshold optimisation for precision-recall tradeoff

## Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 78.16% | 50.56% | 56.65% | 53.43% |
| CatBoost | 77.99% | 50.25% | 51.38% | 50.81% |
| XGBoost | 78.12% | 50.56% | 49.82% | 50.19% |
| Linear SVM | 72.67% | 41.38% | 56.55% | 47.79% |
| Logistic Regression | 71.49% | 39.94% | 57.36% | 47.09% |

- **Best Model:** Random Forest with an F1 score of 53.43%
- **Optimal Threshold:** 0.4867 for improved precision-recall balance

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Jupyter/Colab notebook
- **Data Manipulation**: numpy, pandas
- **Visualisation**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost
- **Imbalance Handling**: imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## Usage
1. Ensure Python and required packages are installed:
2. Download the UCI Credit Card dataset
3. Run the notebook to:
- Preprocess data and engineer features
- Apply SMOTE to balance training data
- Train and evaluate multiple models
- Visualise results and optimise thresholds

## Future Work
