# Kaggle Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects based on Kaggle datasets, implemented in different programming languages and frameworks. The first two are projects that I was originally going to use for my university module but were abandoned at the time due to their large scope.

## Project 1: Aviation Crash Analysis for the Past 100 Years

### Overview
This project analyses aviation crash data spanning more than a century (from 1908 onwards), using R for data processing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning classification. The primary objective is to predict crash causes based on various flight parameters, temporal data, and text analysis of crash descriptions.

### Dataset
The dataset contains detailed records of airplane crashes including:
- Date and time of crashes
- Location information
- Aircraft type and operator details
- Casualty figures (aboard, fatalities, ground casualties)
- Summary descriptions of crash incidents

### Implementation Details
The analysis follows a comprehensive machine learning workflow:

**Data Cleansing**
- Treatment of missing values
- Date and time format standardisation
- Text data preparation

**Feature Engineering**
- Creation of derived features like total fatalities and survival rates
- Text mining from crash summaries
- Categorical time of day classification
- Decade grouping for temporal analysis

**Crash Cause Classification**
- Natural language processing to extract crash causes from summaries
- Categories include:
  - Bad Weather / Natural Disasters
  - Human Error
  - Acts of War / Terrorism
  - Mechanical Failure
  - Other causes

**Machine Learning Models**
- Random Forest classification
- XGBoost implementation
- Naive Bayes classification
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

**Model Evaluation**
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Feature importance assessment
- Classification metrics by crash cause category

### Key Findings
- Human error and mechanical failures constitute the majority of crash causes
- Weather-related crashes show distinct patterns across flight phases
- Crash causes have evolved significantly over different decades
- Text-based features provide strong predictive signal for crash classification
- Random Forest model achieves the highest accuracy for cause prediction

### Tools and Libraries
- **R Language**: Primary implementation
- **Data Manipulation**: dplyr, tidyr, zoo
- **Text Analysis**: tidytext, tm
- **Machine Learning**: caret, randomForest, xgboost, e1071
- **Visualisation**: ggplot2

### Future Work
- Integration of geographical analysis
- Advanced deep learning text classification
- Time series forecasting for crash prediction
- Anomaly detection for unusual crash patterns
- Interactive dashboard for findings exploration

### Usage
The project is implemented in R Markdown notebook format. To run the analysis:
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure R and required packages are installed
3. Open the R Markdown notebook in RStudio
4. Run all chunks sequentially

## Project 3: Diabetes Risk Prediction

### Overview
This project predicts diabetes risk using a range of classical machine learning models on a dataset of patient symptoms and demographic attributes.

### Dataset
- Features: Age, Gender, and 14 symptom indicators (e.g., Polyuria, Polydipsia, sudden weight loss, etc.)
- Target: Diabetes class (Positive/Negative)
- Size: 520 entries

### Implementation Details

#### Data Preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables and binary symptoms as 0/1
- Encode target variable
- Stratified train-test split (70/30)
- Feature standardisation

#### Model Training
Trained and evaluated the following classifiers:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (Linear and RBF kernels)
- Neural Network (MLP)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

#### Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis for tree-based models
- ROC curves and AUC for key models
- 5-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning via grid search

### Results (Example)
- All models achieve high accuracy (94â€“98%)
- Decision Tree and Random Forest achieve 98% accuracy
- Most important features include Polyuria, Polydipsia, sudden weight loss, Age

### Usage
The project is implemented in Python (Jupyter notebook or script).
1. Ensure Python and required packages are installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`)
2. Place `diabetes_data_upload.csv` in the working directory
3. Run the notebook or script
